# Changelog

## 0.2.1 (2026-10-09)

* New `twin-update check [--notify] [--json]`: read-only update check on both
  machines using the apt lists already on disk (no `apt-get update`, no sudo,
  no closes, no installs, no rollback captures). Shows the age of the apt
  lists. Exit codes: 0 no updates, 10 updates available, 1 check incomplete.
* `--notify` notifies only on the machine running the check; the same notice
  at most once per day. Errors use plain wording.
* Works against a peer running 0.2.0 (falls back to `status`).
* README: example user-level systemd timer for a daily check.

## 0.2.0 (2026-10-09)

First public release.

* Fixed: `doctor`, `holds` and `unhold` printed nothing without `--json`
  (also when stdout is not a terminal). Every command now prints plain text;
  anything without a formatter falls back to the JSON report.
* Machines can use the same user name: the config's `machine_id_sha256`
  decides which table is "this machine".
* Machine labels are fully user-defined; docs and examples use generic labels.
* README: security model summary and generic Tailscale policy guidance.
* Packaging metadata for PyPI (classifiers, project URLs).

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-09, not published)

First version.

* `status`, `run`, `rollback`, `holds`, `unhold`, `doctor`, `local --serve`.
* Two machines, one run: identity check, lock files held, sudo asked once,
  same pinned version on both or skipped on both.
* Graceful close only (pidfd SIGTERM); a close timeout aborts on both machines
  before any update, and the apps it closed are reopened.
* Verified rollback copy captured before every update; exactly one kept per app,
  older ones pruned after verification plus a grace period.
* Holds not set by Twin Update are cleared unless `keep_holds` lists them.
* Launch smoke test, per-run JSON report (0600, labels only), desktop notification.
* Single-file zipapp build (compressed); standard library only.
* Rollback copies of vendor debs without an md5sums member are verified by
  hashing the deb's files against dpkg's record; a mismatch is refused, also
  in a dry run.
* Notification falls back to `gdbus` when `notify-send` is not installed and
  soft-fails when neither is; `doctor` reports `notify_tool`.
